Kaba Babel preset
=================

A custom preset for usage in Babel in combination with Kaba.

It limits the available ES2015 functionality, so that a few cases are deliberately not compiled.
It should is based on the [Babel preset `es2015`](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/).


Included transforms
-------------------

A list of all `es2015` transforms and whether they are included.
If they are not included there is also a reason for why they are not included.

Disclaimer
----------

Kaba and this preset are used internally in Becklyn Studios. The reasons stated above might only be valid in the context of this work.

Most of the constraints are filesize based, so that if the compilation heavily increases the code size, the transform is not desired.
